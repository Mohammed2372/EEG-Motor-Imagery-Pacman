## number of samples

tried to change the no of samples form 100 to 1 and still the same acc, tried it before with 1000 but stil the same nothing change in no of samples

## PCA

in pca, i tried k with 4, 16 and 25, when trying k=16, i had about 99% of the components, which is good and when i tried k=4, i had about 95% of the components, which is smaller than k=16 but still good, and with the 3 k values the accuracy was the same which is 29%, the best k value is 16, because it has the most components and the same accuracy as the other k values.

## ICA

- when showing the plots for the 16 components of pca, there are some components that has blinking in it which is not good and needed to be removed and try after removing it.
- when removing the ica components, the accuracy is now 34%
